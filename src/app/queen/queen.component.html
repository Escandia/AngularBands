    <meta name="description" content="Queen are a British rock band that formed in London in 1970.
    Their classic line-up was Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian May (lead guitar, vocals),
    Roger Taylor (drums, vocals), and John Deacon (bass guitar). Queen's earliest works were influenced
    by progressive rock, hard rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more conventional
    and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles, such as arena rock and pop rock, into their music.">

                Just the fact that Freddie would die in a month, and could hardly walk, and somehow sang this stunningly
                powerful and emotional song encapsulates how awesome this song is.Trust me;I've had my share of classical
                music since I was a kid. That one note is something beyond human
