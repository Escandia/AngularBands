    <meta name="description" content="The Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962.
    The original line-up consisted of Brian Jones (rhythm guitar, harmonica), Mick Jagger (lead vocals),
    Keith Richards (lead guitar, backing vocals), Bill Wyman (bass), Charlie Watts (drums), and Ian Stewart
    (piano). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued as a touring member until
     his death in 1985. Jones left the band less than a month prior to his death in 1969, having already been
     replaced by Mick Taylor, who remained until 1974.">

                -With a trippy, playful sound, this song wasn't typical of The Rolling Stones, but it endured as a
                fan favorite. It is a rare pure love song by The Stones, whose songs about women tended to be much
                more libidinous.
